# ChessVisualizer

**ChessVisualizer** is a tool that allows users to visualize chess moves using standard algebraic notation (SAN). It ensures that all moves follow the official rules of chess, providing a seamless way to view and validate chess games.

## Features
- **Move Visualization**: Input moves in standard chess notation (e.g., `e4`, `Nf3`, `Bb5`). The board updates automatically to reflect each move.
- **Rules Validation**: Every move is checked for validity according to chess rules. The system will warn you if an illegal move is attempted.
- **Support for Special Moves**: Includes support for castling, en passant, and promotion.
- **Check & Checkmate Detection**: The system detects check and checkmate scenarios.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndrewSasmito/ChessVisualizer.git
    ```

2. Enter chess moves in standard algebraic notation to see them visualized on the chessboard. For example:
- e4: Moves the pawn to e4.
- Nf3: Moves the knight to f3.
- O-O: Short casting.

3. Invalid moves will be rejected.
